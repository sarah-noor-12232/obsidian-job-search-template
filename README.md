## How to use: Open the checklist file, and download Raw File. You can now open it in Obsidian or any text editor with md support.

Today marks 2 months since I began my job search.

During this time I got to explore a lot of resources for job search, and also finally update my LinkedIn profile. I worked on applying with different scopes, by location, by domain, by type etc.

While one may be inclined to cast a bigger net and explore even more domains and types of work, things can become overwhelming pretty quickly. Soon I was exploring 5-6 job listing sites, trying to learn 4 different engines, and studied more than 4 markets in my industry.

There was simply too much to do! So I handed all the resources and advices I got to chat GPT - and it made a checklist for me to follow. I also picked one specific role to try first.

I want to share the article that mainly helped with this: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/job-market-brutal-heres-how-win-anyway-christopher-ming-onazf/

It contains a neat action plan anyone can follow, with included tools such that you can do your CV building for free.

I have made a general checklist (also generated btw) that anyone can use

This one is made for obsidian, but can easily be adapted as needed. Good luck with your job search!
